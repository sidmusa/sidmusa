= How to type fast like a pro 

These are some sites which can help you type faster. If you don't know how to type without looking at the keyboard, then start with typing.com

After that, try 

https://typegun.com

https://nitrotype.com

https://10fastfingers.com

http://typeracer.com.

typegun is very cool! Just practice daily, even if it's for just 4-5 minutes. Take some tests daily. This will definitely increase your typing speed and if you're a beginner soon you'll be typing around 100 WPM.

If you want to type for longer periods, then you may want to listen to music. Some radio stations can be found at shoutcast.com and internet-radio.com. You can use VLC media player to play the stations. You can also use other players like Cantata if you're on Linux. 

Happy typing!
