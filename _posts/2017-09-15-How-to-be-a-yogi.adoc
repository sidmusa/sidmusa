= How to be a yogi?

Follow the steps of yoga 
 
Ahimsa = Non violence 

Satya = Truth

Asteya = Non stealing

Brahmacharya = Celibacy

Aparigraha = Non greed and satisfied with what one have.

Saucha = Purity

Santosha = Contentment

Tapaha = Austerity

Swadhyaya = Self study 

Iswarapranidhana = Surrender and devotion to God

Asana = Stilling of the mind, being happy with what you have

Pranayama = Breathing control

Pratyahara = Withdrawal of the senses from their objects, not even thinking about anything. 

Dharana = Focusing on a thought stream.

Dhyana = Extended focus on that same over a long period of time without breaking. 

Samadhi = This will happen automatically when Dharana over a long period of time is successful. 

The three combined is Samyama which will lead to states of knowledge. 

This is not word knowledge or thought knowledge, it's a state of higher knowledge.

But note that whether it is pratyahara or asana or brahmacharya, the thing is to reduce the thought streams of the mind.

Doing which will finally completely remove the thought streams, Avarana and Vikshepa shakti, Klesh, Karma and Vipaka. 

Therefore, try to remove Asha or desire. Whenever any desire arises, immediately try to bring the mind back to its blank state. Otherwise, acting upon the desires will lead to a whirpool of desires, thoughts, actions and consequences which may lead to sorrow, sufferings and the cycle of rebirths.
