= How to type really fast 

Here are some sites which can help you type faster. If you don't know how to type without looking at the keyboard, then start with 

https://typingclub.com and https://typing.com

After you've completed some lessons, you can move on to advanced typing lessons or tests. You can practice on any site you personally like. These are my personal favorites:

https://typegun.com

https://nitrotype.com

https://10fastfingers.com

http://typeracer.com

https://ratatype.com

typegun is very cool! Just practice daily, even if it's for just 4-5 minutes. Take some tests daily. This will definitely increase your typing speed and if you're a beginner soon you'll be typing around 100 WPM.

If you want to type for longer periods, then you may want to listen to music. Some great radio stations can be found at: 

https://shoutcast.com 

https://internet-radio.com. 

You can use VLC media player to play the stations. You can also use other players like Cantata if you're on Linux. 

You can also listen to other music streams, for example on YouTube or Mixcloud, but most internet radio stations are of better quality.


Happy typing!
